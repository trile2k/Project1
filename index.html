    <!-- Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) -->
    <section id="saigon">
      <h4>If you come to Vietnam, most likely you will fly into
        <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City">Ho Chi Minh City</a></strong>.
        It is the largest city situated in the South of Vietnam and is also known as
        <strong><a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/where-is-saigon-1458405">Saigon</a></strong>.
        The streets are insanely clog of motorbikes but there’s so much to love about this city,
        including museums, world-class restaurants, luxury hotels, and best of all, street food stalls.</h4>
      <p>First and foremost, you must try <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI7fhQleAkQ">Street
        Food</a></strong> &#45; delicious, cheap, and authentic foods on the city’s sidewalks and alleys.</p>
      <img src="images/saigon/street_food3.jpg" alt="Street Food Scene with 2 girls eating soups">
      <p>You can find lots of <strong><a href="https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/13-fantastic-fruits-vietnam">
        tropical fruits</a></strong> at the local markets or fruit shops along the street. My favorites
        are Mangosteen, Dragon Fruit Longan, and Rambutan.</p>

        traffic of Saigon</a></strong> is an unforgettable experience, so just take a deep breath
        before crossing the street.</p>
