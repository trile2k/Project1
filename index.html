    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="intro">
      <p>I am from <strong>Vietnam</strong>, a wonderful country with friendly people, diverse culture,
        beautiful nature, and amazing food.  Please enjoy my website and pictures below.</p>

    <!-- Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) -->
    <section id="saigon">
      <p>If you come to Vietnam, most likely you will fly into <strong>Ho Chi Minh City</strong>.  It
        is the largest city situated in the South of Vietnam and is also known as <strong>Saigon</strong>.
        The streets are insanely clog of motorbikes but there’s so much to love about this city,
        including museums, world-class restaurants, luxury hotels, and best of all, street food stalls.</p>

      <p>First and foremost, you must try <strong>Street Food</strong> – delicious, cheap, and authentic
        foods on the city’s sidewalks and alleys.</p>

      <p>You can find lots of <strong>tropical fruits</strong> at the local markets or fruit shops along
        the street. My favorites are Mangosteen, Dragon Fruit Longan, and Rambutan.</p>

      <p>The <strong>traffic of Saigon</strong> is an unforgettable experience, so just take a deep breath
        before crossing the street.</p>

      <p>Believe it or not, you can actually fit a <strong>family of 5 on a scooter!</strong></p>

      <p>You can get away from the hectic pace and traffic madness of Saigon and visit

      <p>Lastly, my kid loves to do Rubik’s Cube competitions.  Here is a kid solving with just one
        hand. So amazing!</p>
